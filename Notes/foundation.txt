REACT FUNDAMENTALS

1. Writing script to run the project instead of npx parcel index.html

npx parcel index.html - is used to run the project where index.html is source file.
but we can create script to start the project in dev mode and also build mode.

How can we write the script ?
we write the script in the package .json under scripts
as :
"scripts": {
"test": "jest",
"start": "parcel index.html",
"build": "parcel build index.html"
},

Now how do we start the script?
we use npm run start or npm run build to start the project

Now if in a company we do not no how to start a project , check the package.json file and search for "scripts": {} and we will get teh command from here in any projects.

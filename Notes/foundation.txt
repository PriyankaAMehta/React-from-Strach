REACT FUNDAMENTALS

1. Writing script to run the project instead of npx parcel index.html

   npx parcel index.html - is used to run the project where index.html is source file.
   but we can create script to start the project in dev mode and also build mode.

   How can we write the script ?
   we write the script in the package .json under scripts
   as :
   "scripts": {
   "test": "jest",
   "start": "parcel index.html",
   "build": "parcel build index.html"
   },

   Now how do we start the script?
   we use npm run start or npm run build to start the project

   Now if in a company we do not no how to start a project , check the package.json file and search for "scripts": {} and we will get teh command from here in any projects.

   npm run start is same as npm start
   start is the npm keyword reserved for start

2. JSX : writing the react.createElment("h1", {id: "heading"}, "this is h1") is a very complex and time consuming and hence facebook developers created JSX.
   JSX was created by Facebook, with Jordan Walke being the main engineer behind it, as part of the React project.

   JSX is HTML-like or XML-like syntax. JSX stands for JavaScript
   XML. It's a syntax extension for JavaScript.
   It is not a part of React. React apps can be built even
   without JSX but the code will become very hard to read.
   It is not HTML inside JavaScript.
   JavaScript engine cannot understand JSX as it only
   understands ECMAScript

   JSX is not directly understood by browser , it gives syntax error. So the JSX code is transpilled in plain JavaScript or ES script. This transiplation is done by parcel package.

   Parcel does not do everything itself and is also dependent on other dependencies or packages. It uses Babel package from transpillation.

   How is JSX converted or transpilled?
   JSX is first converted to react element(object) and babel is converting the JSX code to react element.

3. What is BABEL ?
   It is a JavaScript compiler. It converts JSX into react element.
   The older browsers does not inderstand ES6 code so babel transpiles code so that the older browsers are compatible.

4. If the browser can't understand JSX how is it still working?
   This is because of Parcel because "Parcel is a Beast".
   Before the code gets to JS Engine it is sent to Parcel and Transpiled there. Then after transpilation, the browser gets the code that it can understand.

   Transpilation > Converting the code in such a format that the browsers can understand.
   Parcel is like a manager who gives the responsibility of transpilation to a package called Babel.
   Babel is a package that is a compiler/transpiler of JavaScript that is already present inside 'node-modules'. It takes JSX and converts it into the code that browsers understand, as soon as we write it and save the file. It is not created by Facebook.

   → JS Object → HTML Element (render)

5. JSX Atributes : In JSX attributes are in camelCase for ex: className, tabIndex etc

6. Single line JSX and Multi line JSX
   Single line JSX: const heading = <h1 className="heading">I am h1 tag</h1>
   If multline is used, () should be used :
   const heading = (<h1 className="heading">
   I am h1 tag
   </h1>);

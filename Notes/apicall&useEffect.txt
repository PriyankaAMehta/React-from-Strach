1.  Monolithic Architecture :

    1. The whole project is in the same code base. i.e the UI, Backend, Database , authentication is all build in the same code base.

2.  Micorservices Architecture :

    1. In a microservices architecture, the application is divided into multiple small services.
    2. Each service is responsible for one specific task.
    3. For example:
       One microservice handles the UI (frontend)
       Another handles the backend/business logic
       Another manages the database
       Another handles authentication and authorization
    4. Instead of building one large application, the entire project is split into smaller, independent services.
    5. These services can be developed, deployed, and scaled separately.
    6. Each microservice runs on its own port (for example: 1234, 3000, 8080).
    7. All these services can be accessed through one domain name using routing or a gateway.
    8. Example:
       Suppose the UI service runs on port 1234
       It can be accessed as:
       reactseries.com:1234
    9. These ports can be mapped to domain name as :
       reactseries.com/api : so all the backend can be deployed on the same url
       reactseries.com/auth
       reactseries.com/ui
    10. How these services interact : the make calls to apis . for example /ui api wants to interact with backend , it makes a call to backend i.e /api.

3.  How react makes a API call?

    1.  Make the API Call When the Page Loads : Page Loads --> API Call --> Renders

                 In this approach, the API call is made as soon as the page loads.
                 The page waits for the API to return data before it is fully displayed.

                 Example:
                 If the API takes 500 milliseconds to fetch the data,
                 The user will see the complete page after 500 milliseconds.
                 More Explanation

                 How This Works:
                 When the page loads, the browser sends a request to the API.
                 The API processes the request and sends back the data.
                 Once the data is received, the page renders with all the content.

    2.  Load the Page First, Then Make the API Call :  
        Page Loads --> Render the UI --> API Call --> As soon as data comes from API , we popullate the UI or rerender the UI

                    In this approach, the page loads immediately without waiting for the API response.
                    After the page is visible, the API call is made in the background.
                    Once the data is received, the page updates automatically.

                    How This Works:
                    The UI is rendered first (often with empty data or placeholders).
                    The API call is triggered using tools like useEffect in React.
                    When the API response arrives, the UI re-renders with the actual data.

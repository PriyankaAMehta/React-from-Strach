The project is ready for pushing to production is when we have done 
1. Bundling
2. Code Splitting
3. Image Optimization
4. Minification 
5. Code compression 

1. Bundling
What it is: Combining many JavaScript (and CSS) files into one or a few files.
Why: Browsers are slow when they make many network requests.
Tools: Webpack, Vite, Parcel, Rollup.

2. Code splitting 
is the process of breaking your JavaScript code into smaller pieces (chunks), instead of sending one huge file to the browser.
The browser then loads only the code it needs right now.
Other parts are loaded later, on demand.

Why do we need it?
Imagine your app has 1000 lines of code, but the user only sees the homepage first.
Without code splitting:
Browser downloads all 1000 lines immediately → slow load
With code splitting:
Browser downloads only the homepage code → fast load
Other code downloads only when needed (e.g., user clicks “Dashboard”)
This improves performance and user experience.

3. Minification
What it is:
Removing things that computers don’t need:
Spaces
New lines
Comments

4. Compression
Compress files on the server using Gzip or Brotli.
Reduces download size.

NPM
1. NPM does not stand for Node Package Manager. NPM does not have a fullform.
2. NPM manages packages, so behind the scences its a node package manager but it does not stand for  Node Package Manager.
3. NPM is the standard repository for all the packages i.e almost all the packages are hosted in npm. 
For All the libraries , the utilites in the project , we can use NPM. It manages all the packages in the project.
4. how to use npm in the project? - npm init 
we can use npm init -y , it skips some things but we do not want to skip things so we do npm init.
5. On pressing enter after the command npm init , it asks the following questions >

Is this OK? (yes) 

6. package.json file gets added when npm is installed.

What is package.json file which gets added when npm is installed or on npm init ?
1.  It is the configuration for npm. 
So initially right after the npm init is pressed or npm is installed in the project,
package.json file contains all the above questions in the json format.

2. Why do we need package.json ? 
npm is the node package manager, It manages all the packages that we install in our project via npm.
these packages are sometimes also known as dependencies.

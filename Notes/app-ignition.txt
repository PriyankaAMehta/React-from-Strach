The project is ready for pushing to production is when we have done 
1. Bundling
2. Code Splitting
3. Image Optimization
4. Minification 
5. Code compression 

1. Bundling
What it is: Combining many JavaScript (and CSS) files into one or a few files.
Why: Browsers are slow when they make many network requests.
Tools: Webpack, Vite, Parcel, Rollup.

2. Code splitting 
is the process of breaking your JavaScript code into smaller pieces (chunks), instead of sending one huge file to the browser.
The browser then loads only the code it needs right now.
Other parts are loaded later, on demand.

Why do we need it?
Imagine your app has 1000 lines of code, but the user only sees the homepage first.
Without code splitting:
Browser downloads all 1000 lines immediately → slow load
With code splitting:
Browser downloads only the homepage code → fast load
Other code downloads only when needed (e.g., user clicks “Dashboard”)
This improves performance and user experience.

3. Minification
What it is:
Removing things that computers don’t need:
Spaces
New lines
Comments

4. Compression
Compress files on the server using Gzip or Brotli.
Reduces download size.

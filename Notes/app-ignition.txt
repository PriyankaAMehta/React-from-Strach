The project is ready for pushing to production is when we have done

1. Bundling
2. Code Splitting
3. Image Optimization
4. Minification
5. Code compression

6. Bundling
   What it is: Combining many JavaScript (and CSS) files into one or a few files.
   Why: Browsers are slow when they make many network requests.
   Tools: Webpack, Vite, Parcel, Rollup.

7. Code splitting
   is the process of breaking your JavaScript code into smaller pieces (chunks), instead of sending one huge file to the browser.
   The browser then loads only the code it needs right now.
   Other parts are loaded later, on demand.

Why do we need it?
Imagine your app has 1000 lines of code, but the user only sees the homepage first.
Without code splitting:
Browser downloads all 1000 lines immediately → slow load
With code splitting:
Browser downloads only the homepage code → fast load
Other code downloads only when needed (e.g., user clicks “Dashboard”)
This improves performance and user experience.

3. Minification
   What it is:
   Removing things that computers don’t need:
   Spaces
   New lines
   Comments

4. Compression
   Compress files on the server using Gzip or Brotli.
   Reduces download size.

NPM

1. NPM does not stand for Node Package Manager. NPM does not have a fullform.
2. NPM manages packages, so behind the scences its a node package manager but it does not stand for Node Package Manager.
3. NPM is the standard repository for all the packages i.e almost all the packages are hosted in npm.

For All the libraries , the utilites in the project , we can use NPM. It manages all the packages in the project. 4. how to use npm in the project? - npm init
we can use npm init -y , it skips some things but we do not want to skip things so we do npm init. 5. On pressing enter after the command npm init , it asks the following questions >

Is this OK? (yes)

6. package.json file gets added when npm is installed.

What is package.json file which gets added when npm is installed or on npm init ?

1.  It is the configuration for npm.
    So initially right after the npm init is pressed or npm is installed in the project,
    package.json file contains all the above questions in the json format.

2.  Why do we need package.json ?
    npm is the node package manager, It manages all the packages that we install in our project via npm.
    these packages are sometimes also known as dependencies.
    packages and dependencies are same.
    npm manages these dependencies, it takes care of what is the version of these pacakages or dependencies.
    so pacakage.json contains or takes care of the versions of all the packages installed via npm.

3.  Installing dependencies or packages in project.

3.1 -- 1st dependency or package -- PARCEL
BUNDLER - the project contains html, css , js etc files. BUNDLER bunldes all the files together, minifies the project, compresses it before moving our code to production.
Some examples of bundlers used are > webpack, parcel, vite etc

Bundlers are packages. If we want to use a package in our
code, we have to use a package manager.
We use a package manager known as npm or yarn

create-react-app uses webpack as the bundler.
for practice purpose we will now use parcel as bundler.

How to install anz pacakage or dependency from npm?
use npm install <pakage name>

There are 2 types of pacakages or dependencies:

1. dev dependency : is the dependency or packages that we need during development.
2. normal dependency : these are used during development and also during production.

Since we need parcel for Bundling our app to get ready to go to production , we would onlz need it during development.
so we use -D while installing pacakages or dependencies from npm. so the command is npm install -D parcel.

As soon as the PARCEL is installed via npm we have follwing files added :

1. node_modules folder
2. pacakage/lock.json

As pacakage.json is the configuration file for npma dn takes care of all the version of the packages or dependencies added
via npm : the parcel package version is also added in the package.json file as devDependency:
"devDependencies": {
"parcel": "^2.16.3"
}

^ - is the caret
~ - is the tilde

2.3.1 version to 2.3.4 or 2.3.7 is minor version upgrade
but from version 2.3.1 or 2.3.8 to 3.1.0 is a major udpdate.

^ - caret - if there is a minor udpdate in any of the packages , caret will automatically update the package.
~ - tilde - if tilde is used, it will automatically install the major update.

its always safe to use ^ - caret in most of the case because if teh major update is installed , it may break the app because of the other dependencies versions.

What is package-lock.json?
This file keeps the track of exact version of the packages.

If package.json specifies a dependency version like ^2.3.1 and a newer compatible minor or patch version (for example, 2.3.5) is available, the version in package.json remains ^2.3.1, while package-lock.json is updated to reflect the exact installed version (2.3.5).

If package.json has a version like ^2.3.1, it means “any compatible version starting from 2.3.1 but below 3.0.0.”
So, if a new version like 2.3.5 comes out, package.json still shows ^2.3.1 because that’s the allowed range.
The package-lock.json, however, records the exact version actually installed (like 2.3.5) to make sure everyone gets the same version.

What are the other things in package-lock.json?
When we install Parcel using npm install parcel, npm creates or updates two important things: package-lock.json and the node_modules folder.

The package-lock.json file contains the exact version of Parcel that was installed. In addition to Parcel itself, it also lists all the dependencies that Parcel requires to work, such as its transformers, optimizers, and other internal packages. It further includes the dependencies of those packages as well. In short, package-lock.json is a complete record of the entire dependency tree with exact versions, ensuring that the same versions are installed every time on any machine.

What is node_module folder created when parcel is installed?
At the same time, npm creates the node_modules folder. This folder contains the actual code for Parcel and all of its dependencies that are needed at runtime. Parcel cannot run without these files, so npm downloads them and places them inside node_modules.
The reason the node_modules folder is created is that JavaScript projects do not bundle dependencies by default. Instead, npm installs the required packages locally so that the application and tools like Parcel can import and use them. The node_modules folder is not committed to Git because it can always be recreated using package.json and package-lock.json.

In summary:
package-lock.json records what exact versions of Parcel and its dependencies are installed.
node_modules contains the actual installed files needed for Parcel to run.

Is other only 1 package.json file in the whole project?
No, every packet or dependency in the node_modules folder contains its own package.json file.

Should we push the node_modules file in the production or to the github?
No, since its a very heavy file, It should not be pushed to production or github.

Create a .gitignore file and put the node_modules in the file to avoid it be pushed to github.

If package.json and package-lock.json files are present, node_modules can be re-generated via npm install command.

There are 2 ways to get react into the project.

1. CDN links
2. NPM

React is JS package or JS code at the end and it is hosted on NPM
so we can get react via npm

CDN IS NOT A PREFRED WAY TO GET REACT AND REACT_DOM INTO THE PROJECT.

why CDN is not prefred way ?
Using a CDN is generally not the preferred way to include libraries like React in modern projects.
One reason is that network requests are costly. When we load React from a CDN (for example, from unpkg.com), the browser has to make an additional network request to download React at runtime. However, when we install React using npm, the package is already available locally inside the node_modules folder, so no extra network call is required during development or build time. This makes access faster and more reliable.
Another important reason is version management. When using a CDN, if the React version changes (for example, from React 17 to React 18), we must manually update the CDN URL everywhere it is used. This can easily lead to version mismatches or errors. In contrast, when React is added as a dependency in package.json, npm handles versioning for us. Updating, locking, or rolling back versions becomes much easier and more consistent across the project.

So we will install react as a package via npm

How? - npm install react
This installs the latest version of react.
currently it is version 19.2.3

We need 2 files react and react-dom, now we have just installed 1 i.e react

Install ReactDOM via npm - npm install react-dom

Now react and react-dom are there is the package.json, package-lock.json and node_modules folder.

now react and react-dom are installed, run this project using npx parcel index.html.
will this work? NO , error - react is not defined as shown in the console.
because earlier this worked with CDN links because react was coming from CDN links and now it does not work or shows error because the we have react and react-dom in our node_modules and we need to import it.

now react and react-dom are imported from node_modules. Will this work? NO
error ? -
Build failed.

@parcel/transformer-js: Browser scripts cannot have imports or exports.

/Users/priyankamehta/Desktop/Namaste React/App.js:1:1

> 1 | import React from "react";
> | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    2 | import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
    3 |

/Users/priyankamehta/Desktop/Namaste React/index.html:22:1
21 | -->

> 22 | <script src="App.js"></script>
> | ^ The environment was originally created here

    23 |   </body>
    24 | </html>

Reason :

<script src="App.js"></script> is treated as normal JavaScript in the browser and normal JS cannot have imports or exports.

Solution:
so add type="module" to the script. <script type="module" src="App.js"></script>. Now browser will treat this as module and not normal JS.

Error : create-root is not a function.
Soultion : import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client"; use /client.

What does parcel do to applications?

1. Dev Build
2. Local Server
3. HMR - Hot Module Replacement
4. File Watching algorithm written in C
5. Caching - Faster build
6. Minification
7. Bundling
8. Compressing
9. Consistent hashing
10. Code Splitting
11. Differential Bundling - support for older browsers
12. Dignostics and better error handling
13. parcel gives a way to develop on HTTPS
14. Tree Shaking Algorithm : suppose we have 100 of functions in the code but if we use just 5 - 10 functions them parcel will remove all of the unwanted code.

Anything that can be regenrated should not be pushed to git and should be written in .gitignore file : .parcel-cache and dist should be in .gitignore.

The create-react-app contains all the above already in the project.

How to make our project compatible for older versions of browsers?
browsersList - The browserslist configuration already exists in node_modules, but we now need to explicitly define which browsers and versions our project should support.

although browserlist is a npm package and already present in the node_modules, we need to configure it in package.json.

"browserslist":[
"last 10 chrome versions",
"last 10 firefox versions"
]

but does it mean that our project will work in only the 2 listed browsers?
No , it means that our app will definetly work in the above 2 listed browsers and it might or might not work in rest of the browsers.

How did we understand what to write in the browserlists array ?
https://browserslist.dev/ - gives the list of all the browsers and versions. type last 2 chrome versions and check.

suppose if we type last 2 versions in the https://browserslist.dev/, it covers almost 79% coverage

so if we give last 10 versions. it covers almost 97%.

When do we use it ? if we have any website which needs to reach lot of people so it should have coverage of almost 90% and above such like the government websites

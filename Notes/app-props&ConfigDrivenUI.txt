4. CSS - FLEX
   Flexbox is a layout model for arranging items (horizontally or vertically) within a container, in a flexible and responsive way.

   Flexbox makes it easy to design a flexible and responsive layout, without using float or positioning.

   HTML
   <div class="container">
    <div>Item 1</div>
    <div>Item 2</div>
    <div>Item 3</div>  
    <div>Item 4</div>
    <div>Item 5</div>
   </div>

   CSS
   .container {
   display: flex;}

   Flexbox must have a parent element with the display property set to flex or inline-flex.

   Direct child elements of the flex container automatically becomes flex items.i.e all the Item 1 to Item 5 automatically becomes flex.

   Flex Properties:
   display - Must be set to flex or inline-flex
   flex-direction - Sets the display-direction of flex items
   flex-wrap - Specifies whether the flex items should wrap or not
   flex-flow - Shorthand property for flex-direction and flex-wrap
   justify-content - Aligns the flex items when they do not use all available space on the main-axis (horizontally)
   align-items - Aligns the flex items when they do not use all available space on the cross-axis (vertically)
   align-content - Aligns the flex lines when there is extra space in the cross axis and flex items wrap

   The justify-content property has following values:
   center : The center value aligns the flex items in the center of the container.
   flex-start (default) : The flex-start value aligns the flex items at the beginning of the container (this is default)
   flex-end : The flex-end value aligns the flex items at the end of the container.
   space-around : value displays the flex items with space around them
   space-between
   space-evenly

5. Whenever we need to reuse the same pice of code always create a new componet > for examaple : The restaurant card.

6. Inline css in JSX is given as:

   1. first declared as a object.

      const stylecard = {
      backgroundColor: "#f0f0f0",
      };

   2. used that object inside {} as :
      <div className="res-card" style={stylecard}>
      <h3>Mehta Foods</h3>
      </div>

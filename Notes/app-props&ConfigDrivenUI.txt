1.  This gives the learning about Props and Config Driven UI

2.  This branch starts to develop the food delivery app.

3.  Planning of food delivery app or any application
    3.1 should start with wireframe which makes it easier to develop frontend.
    3.2 planning basic structure of components
    Header

    - Logo
    - Nav Items

      Body

    - Search
    - Restaurant container
    - Restaurant cards

      - Dish Name
      - Image
      - Restaurant Name
      - Rating
      - Cuisines
      - Time to Deliver

4.  CSS - FLEX
    Flexbox is a layout model for arranging items (horizontally or vertically) within a container, in a flexible and responsive way.

    Flexbox makes it easy to design a flexible and responsive layout, without using float or positioning.

    HTML
    <div class="container">
     <div>Item 1</div>
     <div>Item 2</div>
     <div>Item 3</div>  
     <div>Item 4</div>
     <div>Item 5</div>
    </div>

    CSS
    .container {
    display: flex;}

    Flexbox must have a parent element with the display property set to flex or inline-flex.

    Direct child elements of the flex container automatically becomes flex items.i.e all the Item 1 to Item 5 automatically becomes flex.

    Flex Properties:
    display - Must be set to flex or inline-flex
    flex-direction - Sets the display-direction of flex items
    flex-wrap - Specifies whether the flex items should wrap or not
    flex-flow - Shorthand property for flex-direction and flex-wrap
    justify-content - Aligns the flex items when they do not use all available space on the main-axis (horizontally)
    align-items - Aligns the flex items when they do not use all available space on the cross-axis (vertically)
    align-content - Aligns the flex lines when there is extra space in the cross axis and flex items wrap

    The justify-content property has following values:
    center : The center value aligns the flex items in the center of the container.
    flex-start (default) : The flex-start value aligns the flex items at the beginning of the container (this is default)
    flex-end : The flex-end value aligns the flex items at the end of the container.
    space-around : value displays the flex items with space around them
    space-between
    space-evenly

5.  Whenever we need to reuse the same pice of code always create a new componet > for examaple : The restaurant card.

6.  Inline css in JSX is given as:

    1. first declared as a object.

       const stylecard = {
       backgroundColor: "#f0f0f0",
       };

    2. used that object inside {} as :
       <div className="res-card" style={stylecard}>
       <h3>Mehta Foods</h3>
       </div>

7.  A card component : why a separate component ? because Its reuseable.

    const RestaurantCard = () => {
    return (
    <div
    className="res-card"
    style={{
            backgroundColor: "#f0f0f0",
        }} >
    <img
            className="res-image"
            src="https://media-assets.swiggy.com/swiggy/image/upload/fl_lossy,f_auto,q_auto,w_660/0335dd45be555d0a4187255e57d2ca88"
        />
    <h3>Mehta Foods</h3>
    <h4>Pizza, Pasta, Italian</h4>
    <h4>4.5 stars</h4>
    <h4>38 minutes</h4>
    </div>
    );
    };

    const Body = () => {
    return (
    <div className="body">
    <div className="Search">Search</div>
    <div className="res-container">
    <RestaurantCard />
    <RestaurantCard />
    </div>
    </div>
    );
    };

8.  The above example, we hard coded it and we had 2 same restaurant card with Mehta Foods now If we want to display other cards with different names, menus, ratings, delivery times, etc., writing the same HTML again and again is not a good approach.
    Instead of hard-coding or duplicating the same HTML, we use React’s props concept. With props, we define one reusable card structure (HTML skeleton) and pass different data to it, such as names, menu items, ratings, and delivery times. This way, the same component can be reused to display multiple restaurant cards with different information.

9.  What are Props in React? (Step-by-Step)
    Step 1: Meaning of Props
    Props (short for properties) are values that are passed from one React component to another.
    They help components receive data from their parent component.

Step 2: Props and Functional Components
Functional components in React are just JavaScript functions.
Just like functions receive arguments
React components receive props
So, props are the arguments passed to a functional component.

Step 3: How React Handles Props
When you pass data to a component:
<RestaurantCard resName="Mehta Foods" cuisines="pizza, pasta, fries" />
React does the following:
Takes all the passed properties (resName, cuisines)
Wraps them inside a single object
Passes that object to the component as props

Step 4: Props Are an Object
Inside the component, props is an object.
console.log(props);
Output:
{
resName: "Mehta Foods",
cuisines: "pizza, pasta, fries"
}

Step 5: Accessing Props
Since props is an object, you access its values using dot notation:
props.propertyName
Example:
props.resName
props.cuisines

Example Explained Step-by-Step
Step 6: RestaurantCard Component
const RestaurantCard = (props) => {
console.log(props);

        return (
            <div
            className="res-card"
            style={{ backgroundColor: "#f0f0f0" }}
            >
            <img
                className="res-image"
                src="https://media-assets.swiggy.com/swiggy/image/upload/fl_lossy,f_auto,q_auto,w_660/0335dd45be555d0a4187255e57d2ca88"
            />
            <h3>{props.resName}</h3>
            <h4>{props.cuisines}</h4>
            <h4>4.5 stars</h4>
            <h4>38 minutes</h4>
            </div>
        );
        };
        🔹 RestaurantCard is a functional component
        🔹 props is received as a parameter
        🔹 props.resName and props.cuisines display dynamic data

Step 7: Passing Props from Parent Component

const Body = () => {
return (

<div className="body">
<div className="Search">Search</div>

      <div className="res-container">
        {/* Passing props to the component */}
        <RestaurantCard
          resName="Mehta Foods"
          cuisines="pizza, pasta, fries"
        />

        <RestaurantCard
          resName="Dominos"
          cuisines="pizza, pasta, Garlic butter"
        />
      </div>
    </div>

);
};
🔹 Body is the parent component
🔹 RestaurantCard is the child component
🔹 Different values are passed as props to each card

Summary
Props are used to pass data to components
Functional components receive props as function parameters
React groups all props into a single object
Props are accessed using props.propertyName
Props make components reusable and dynamic
